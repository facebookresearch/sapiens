    """ResNet backbone for CIFAR.

    Compared to standard ResNet, it uses `kernel_size=3` and `stride=1` in
    conv1, and does not apply MaxPoolinng after stem. It has been proven to
    be more efficient than standard ResNet in other public codebase, e.g.,
    `https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/blob/master/models/resnet.py`.

    Args:
        depth (int): Network depth, from {18, 34, 50, 101, 152}.
        in_channels (int): Number of input image channels. Default: 3.
        stem_channels (int): Output channels of the stem layer. Default: 64.
        base_channels (int): Middle channels of the first stage. Default: 64.
        num_stages (int): Stages of the network. Default: 4.
        strides (Sequence[int]): Strides of the first block of each stage.
            Default: ``(1, 2, 2, 2)``.
        dilations (Sequence[int]): Dilation of each stage.
            Default: ``(1, 1, 1, 1)``.
        out_indices (Sequence[int]): Output from which stages. If only one
            stage is specified, a single tensor (feature map) is returned,
            otherwise multiple stages are specified, a tuple of tensors will
            be returned. Default: ``(3, )``.
        style (str): `pytorch` or `caffe`. If set to "pytorch", the stride-two
            layer is the 3x3 conv layer, otherwise the stride-two layer is
            the first 1x1 conv layer.
        deep_stem (bool): This network has specific designed stem, thus it is
            asserted to be False.
        avg_down (bool): Use AvgPool instead of stride conv when
            downsampling in the bottleneck. Default: False.
        frozen_stages (int): Stages to be frozen (stop grad and set eval mode).
            -1 means not freezing any parameters. Default: -1.
        conv_cfg (dict | None): The config dict for conv layers. Default: None.
        norm_cfg (dict): The config dict for norm layers.
        norm_eval (bool): Whether to set norm layers to eval mode, namely,
            freeze running stats (mean and var). Note: Effect on Batch Norm
            and its variants only. Default: False.
        with_cp (bool): Use checkpoint or not. Using checkpoint will save some
            memory while slowing down the training speed. Default: False.
        zero_init_residual (bool): Whether to use zero init for last norm layer
            in resblocks to let them behave as identity. Default: True.
